# LiveKit Coding Challenge Submission

## Overview
I was able to complete the first requirement of the challenge within the 4-hour timeframe. While I couldn't complete all requirements, I wanted to demonstrate my approach and thought process.

## Completed Work
- [x] Implemented the basic WebSocket connection to LiveKit
- [x] Established initial room participation logic
- [x] Intake of first name, with confirmation. (spelled back to user with phonetic alphabet)
- [x] Intake of last name, with confirmation. (spelled back to user with phonetic alphabet)
- [x] Intake of insurance ID. 

## Challenges Faced
1. **LiveKit Learning Curve**: Understanding the LiveKit ecosystem and WebSocket protocol took significant time. 
2. **Time Constraints**: The 4-hour window was challenging for learning new technologies while implementing

## Next Steps (If Given More Time)
1. Pool the data in a format for api call to STEDI
2. Create a second agent that will work with the information given back from STEDI
    a. class SecondAgent(Assistant): inorder to get the user_data context into the second agent.
3. More clear and defined fallback methods for the agents to invoke when information from intake is missing or misrepresented
4. Separation of code into other files for cleanliness

## Key Learnings
Through this challenge, I've gained:
- Basic understanding of LiveKit's WebSocket API
- Experience working with real-time communication protocols

## Request for Consideration
While I couldn't complete all requirements in the given time, I'm confident that with more time (or in a real work environment with team support), I could deliver a complete solution. I'm a quick learner and would appreciate the opportunity to discuss how I would approach the remaining components.
